OBSERVATION:

C:\Users\hp\Desktop>java -cp . Main18
20

#As java follows operator precedence rule,where multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+).
Thast why we get 20 as output

#whereas I can change this precedence of multiplication operator by using parentheses,in that case addition operation will get executed.
