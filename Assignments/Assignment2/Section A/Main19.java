OBSERVATION:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at Main19.main(Main19.java:20)


#Division by zero is not allowed in java and results in an ArithmeticException at runtime,this is because there is no valid integer  for division by zero
#but in case of float and double it does give me infinity and not exception.
#To fix this error we can use datatypes such as float or double.
