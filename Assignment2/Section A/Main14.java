OBSERVATION :
error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to double
 double num = "Hello";
(Compilation Error)

#The variable num is declared as double, which means it should hold a numeric (floating-point) value
#Hello is a String, which cannot be assigned to a double because they are incompatible data types.

#Java enforce data type constraints to avoid  runtime issues by catching incorrect assignments at compile-time.
