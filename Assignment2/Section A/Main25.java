OBSERVATION:

 error: selector type double is not allowed
 switch(score) {


#The given Java program does not compile because the switch statement is trying to use a double value (score = 85.0), which is not allowed as a switch expression.

#I did some research and i found out that
 In Java, switch expressions only support certain data types. As per Java's rules, a switch statement can work with:
 byte, short, char, int
 Their corresponding wrapper classes (Byte, Short, Character, Integer)
 String,enum types
 Floating-point types (float and double) are not supported because they can have precision issues, which may lead to 
 unexpected behavior in comparisons.
